                <p class="mx-5">Finding sufficient talent to fill the needed labor force has proven to be a serious challenge that
                    seems to defy the best planning that communities can perform.  There are jobs to be filled without
                    enough qualified individuals to fill them, and there are jobs that need to be created, assuming that
                    qualified individuals can be found.  How does a community address this challenge?  Community
                    Stakeholders are the key.  However, working, independently and collectively, they lack accessible ]
                    information that helps with informed decision-making and follow-through. Just who are the
                    Stakeholders? What kind of easy-to-use guidance is available? The guidance champions four (4)
                    pillars of prosperity – measurable talent(Credential Holders), momentum, structure, and support that
                    are at the heart of “Building an Economy on Talent (BET). Everyone is interested in improving the
                    prosperity of their respective county, city, region and state. Being aware of basic facts and partnerships among stakeholders is a good place to start. Their knowledge and engagement lead to improving: 1) continuous talent development and innovation, 2) job creation 3) job retention and 4) business recruitment including startups. This Guide provides a basis upon which citizens (stakeholders) take responsibility and inspire each other and their affiliated organizations. You will find what you have in common and understand each other’s needs
                    so as to take steps that result in “economic prosperity”, writ large.
                </p>
                 <h4>Existing Economic Development Groups and Stakeholders</h4>
                 <p>It is recognized that counties and cities have groups and thought leaders that devote time to
                     economic development. However, alignment of efforts by the aforementioned could be mutually
                     beneficial. This goes a long way toward nourishing a culture that attracts talented people from
                     everywhere.
                 </p>
                 <p>Practices, ideas and experiences generate more conversations and actions that extend beyond you and
                     create a wider and lasting impact. Taking time to share and celebrate what’s working and what’s
                     not are mutually beneficial. In other words, take time to pause, reflect, and reenergize. As a
                     routine practice, this leads to continuous inspiration, learning, and improvement, putting Building
                     an Economy on Talent (BET) into a habit of practice.

                 <p>Invitation & Questionaire - includes current and prospective employees. You are invited to complete
                     the one-minute survey that follows. Record your responses on a separate sheet of paper. Please
                     share with your closest stakeholders. Such sharing is critical to follow up that maximizes talent
                     and economic development.
                 </p>
                 <h5>Questionaire</h5>
                 <ol>
                     <li>Name the top  three (3) competencies that companies require within the workforce in order to enable businesses to become “best in class”.</li>
                     <li> I am concerned that the “talent pool” in the surrounding region has limited human capital possessing the necessary competencies to meet future growth and performance requirements. (-SD –D—A—SA )</li>
                     <li>In order to offset the loss of retiring upper-level management, it would be an effective way forward if motivated and experienced employees at the middle-level of management were able to effectively upgrade their competencies. (SD­--D–A--SA--)</li>
                     <li>It is important to support employees to improve their competencies by contributing toward or reimbursing their investment in improving their competencies, with the understanding that they would  reimburse the company’s investment if they were to leave within a specific time. (SD—D—A – SA--) </li>
                     <li>I would be happy to support the certification of training classes by the business for college credit (SD--D--A --SA--)</li>
                     <li>I would increase collaboration with higher educations if they would  be more responsive to meeting businesses talent needs.</li>
                 </ol>
                 <p> What follows here is an east-to- use Guide: A summary of what to expect upon implementation, and an essential step-by-step guidance follows</p>
                 <p>Summary of what happens when this process is implemented:</p>
                 <ol>
                     <li>Presentation of basic facts about Labor Force and Credentials (Talent), including  measurable key performance objectives relative to Credentials</li>
                     <li>Directions for finding jobs/occupations locally and nationwide</li>
                     <li>Awareness and involvement of stakeholders to make significant contributions of support to talent and economic development</li>
                     <li>A strong community-wide approach to talent-pool supply chains for a sustainable and robust economy</li>
                     <li>Emboldened leadership of everyone in a collaborative effort at scale regarding talent and economic development</li>
                     <li>Established  series of questions to elicit ongoing inquiry and responses among stakeholders in an inviting and constructive way</li>
                 </ol>
                 <p>Step by Step Guidance to implementation:</p>
                 <p>This Guide provides directions about linkages among stakeholders via lines of questioning to establish clear communications and effective collaboration. All of this has a basis in facts about Labor Force and Credentials relative to the State, County, Region of choice selected from the drop-down menu provided. Stakeholders are those who, independently and collectively, establish ongoing pathways:</p>
                 <ol>
                     <li>Students (recent higher education graduates and K-12 students)</li>
                     <li>Higher education and K-12 educators</li>
                     <li>Employers and Employees</li>
                     <li>Elected Officials, Chancellors/Presidents, Chambers of Commerce executives, Superintendents, Principals, and Economic Developers/Planners</li>
                     <li>Faith-based Pastors/groups and Parents</li>
                 </ol>
                 <p>Data sets pertain to qualifying Credentials and Labor Force. Lines of questioning are applied to self analyze the data as well as to activate pathways for ongoing economic success. The pathways foster an ongoing quality workforce, business growth, and connections that engage stakeholders as partners to achieve the objective of quality credential holders (true north direction to which stakeholders are committed), and to reach the ultimate goal of sustaining economic prosperity.</p>
                 <p>Pathways, established by stakeholders ultimately lead to: A) generating at scale talent development, B) creating a culture of ongoing learning in a climate of constant change, and C) building awareness of the importance among everyone as a contributor to talent and economic development. Such pathways lead to a common purpose and are something to share in, be passionate about, and celebrate.</p>
                 <p>This Guide incorporates a standard line of questions and guidance that always stay the same. At the same time, the data sets, tailored to the State, County, Region of choice, change and are updated periodically.</p>
                 <p>Hamilton County, Tennessee is the choice area of this report. Please follow the narrative for analysis and pathways about Talent (credentials), Labor Force, and Occupations</p>
                 <p>Mastering the capabilities of linking, knowing, and relating are the three keys to maximizing the impact that available Talent and a strong Labor Force have on building viable businesses. Where then should we turn for guidance in mastering these capabilities? While there is a myriad of comprehensive and complex sources of information for answering this question, most people do not take the time nor have the skill to examine and decipher this data for decision making.</p>
                 <p>The following Guide offers an easily understood and less complex approach. Data that are illustrated in the tables ( Labor  Force, Education level, employment/unemployment ) are after-the-fact-translations. Tracking these data helps establish standards as important benchmarks, however, that is insufficient. Constantly looking through the rearview mirror only gives an image of the past. A review of the past can be instructive only within the context of a vision of what is projected for the future. Therefore, it sets up the importance of the key performance objective, as it sheds light on the future, regarding  Labor force, Education  Achievement, as well as Employment/Unemployment. This is the Credential Holder Objective (CHO), identified previously. The CHO expresses the projected future that becomes a measurable benchmark. Therefore, these projected data,  considered along with after-the-fact translations, establish a frame of mind and focus that stimulates one’s will and determination to meet and/or exceed the performance criterion. The human spirit is the power that creates more 1) talent and innovation, 2) job creation 3) job retention and 4) business retention, recruitment, including startups. It sets up the Credential Holder Objective (CHO), which is the percentage of potential employees with credentials from the credential pool (associate, bachelor and above degrees), as a key performance indicator to identify the gaps in necessary credentials to meet the anticipated needs of the Labor Force by 2026. The CHO, expressed in measurable terms, provides a source of motivation and unanimity for stakeholders to achieve the objective by implementing various actions set forth in the platform.</p>
                 <p>The Credential Holder Objective (CHO) is the true north direction to which each stakeholder in Labor Force development should be committed. The concept of a CHO for a selected county, region, and state allows stakeholder ownership of the CHO to establish rapport with each other by focusing their conversation on the coordinated steps necessary to close the gap indicated by the CHO. Further, insight about the CHO can be gleaned from the Labor Force data showing the number of persons employed and unemployed. The unemployed are those that are available, willing to work, and still in the labor force. Therefore, the employed and unemployed make up the Labor Force available for the production of goods and service. The strength of using the CHO approach is that it can incorporate dynamic changes such as the employment rate falling when the unemployed give up on finding a job and leave the Labor Force.</p>
                 <p>Understanding the Labor Force gives each stakeholder an idea of existing jobs and job opportunities for those who have the needed credentials to be productive. Therefore, credential holders become more and more important, as existing businesses expand and new businesses grow. This opens opportunities for individuals to up-skill, earn a degree (associates, bachelors or higher), and/or secure a professional certification.</p>
                 <p>Data-sets of this Guide apply to Labor Force and Credentials related to Hamilton County, Tennessee. The estimated Labor Force of those 25-64 years of age by 2026 is expected to be ~ 134,327 and the necessary Credential Holders to support the labor force is estimated to be ~ 206,866 projected for 2026. Therefore, the percentage of Credential Holders will be only 64.9 % of what is needed from the pool to support the projected Labor Force in 2026.</p>

                 </div>
                 <p>Data in Table 1 provide a general picture of those employed, unemployed, and not in the Labor Force. An analysis of the greatest and least number in the Labor Force and Not in the Labor Force by educational attainment is instructive. Which categories seem to have the greatest employment, the least unemployment, and greatest Not in the Labor Force? Could these categories become target populations for skilling, reskilling, up-skilling, and motivated to be employed, including reemployment? Could an increase in jobs and new businesses stimulate growth among those with some college/Associate degree and above? Could those with some college Not in the Labor Force become a source for up-skilling? Could those with a bachelor’s degree and above Not in the Labor Force possibly be a source in need of pursuing an enhanced degree that may be in greater demand? What might be the impact on stimulating a greater supply of Credential Holders in all categories to benefit desired business growth and stimulate the economy? In general, what can be gleaned from these data regarding Credential Holder supply and demand?</p>
                 <p>Also, Table 2, shown below, shows labor force characteristics by occupation and industry.</p>
                <div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center p-4">

                <div class="table-responsive-sm">
                    {{ tables[1]|safe }}

                </div>
                <p>Questions by stakeholders that may be discussed relative to these data may include: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Are learning opportunities in the area of focus fully aligned with jobs that business need?</li>
                    <li>Are job applicants sufficiently prepared to build, create and problem solve?</li>
                    <li>What actions are being undertaken in which stakeholders have a common focus to improve access, delivery of skilling, reskilling, upskilling and motivating full employment including reemployment? (This would include Credential Enhancement integrated with a degree or independently that enhances one’s portfolio alignment with specific jobs/occupations. Such enhancements would include certifications, micro-credentials, digital badges, micro- certificates, licensure, and “relevant experiences.” Enhancements of this nature are timelier to achieve and are focused on specific skills and competencies.)</li>
                    <li>Are skills/competencies of the Labor Force including potential applicants from local providers at a level that helps businesses now and in the future?</li>
                    <li>What actions are underway to combine acquiring academic credentials, including degrees, short-term certificates, internet courses, and “relevant experiences” as an integrated package that meet the needs of businesses now and the future?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Those not in the Labor Force but holding a credential may be employed in a different county/region or state, or the credential held does not match up with an employer’s need in the county/region selected. Those credential holders who are not interested in working outside the selected county may consider up-skilling to become more marketable. However, they may elect to accept a position for which they are overqualified while waiting for a job that opens in the field for which they have more fitting credentials.</p>
                <p>The Guide utilizes data derived from consecutive 5-year American Community Surveys, US Census Bureau, including years of 2016, 2017, & 2018, for the population 25-64 years of age. These data have been extrapolated through 2026, utilizing a 3-consecutive-year (5 year--2016; 5 year--2017; 5 year--2018) forecasting technique*. The 25-64-year-old population accounts for the majority of individuals that make up the Labor Force. It is recognized, however, that individuals are continuing to work beyond the age of 64. Also, since this population makes up, in general, the majority of the Labor Force, younger people developing credentials come online within approximately three years of completing their credential, often entering the workforce in entry-level jobs.</p>
                <p>Employers are no longer on the sidelines of mobilizing skill/talent development. Rather, they are front-and-center as coequal partners with education enterprises (K-12 schools; technical schools; community colleges; four-year universities; apprenticeships; gov’t workforce programs; online platforms). Such partnerships mobilize a scalable pool of future employees equipped with the skills in demand by employers.</p>
                <p>Notice* Statistical testing to determine the error of measurement has not been applied to the consecutive three-year rolling averages forecast for 2026. The impact of increasing the number of periods results in a smoothing effect. This suggests that there may be little change in the underlying pattern, while illustrating general trends. These forecast data reflect only estimated approximations, while being instructive for stakeholder decision-making and action. </p>
                <h5>Use of Data by Stakeholders</h5>
                <p>This Guide provides stakeholders with streamlined reporting that reduces excessive time to ferret out meaningful trends. It allows for targeted actions, such as being more proactive, recognizing skill gaps, and engaging with stakeholder partners that lead to job opportunities, curriculum changes to meet employer needs, strategic business recruitment, retention, entrepreneurial development and allocating financial resources.</p>
                <h5><b><u>Student Stakeholders</u></b></h5>
                <p>Given the Credential Holder Objective and Labor force-employment and unemployment data for a particular geographic region, higher education graduates, who have decided on a career interest and prepared a resume, may check out the job market via internet links by a Google search of entering Jobs in the state of choice, selected from the drop down screen.</p>
                <h5><b><u>K-12 Teacher/Student Stakeholder</u></b></h5>
                <p>Upon reviewing the CHO and Labor Force data with students regarding their importance, proceed by introducing students to O*Net Interest Profile to begin career exploration. This is an excellent tool for assessing interest and learning about jobs/careers. Supplemental resources regarding jobs may be found on the internet, according to state data, by doing a google search, entering the State of choice and State Department of Labor and Market Information.</p>
                <h5><b><u>Employer/Employee Stakeholders</u></b></h5>
                <p>Given the aforementioned data, focusing on the Credential Holder Objective and workforce information, employers, as a front-and-center coequal partner in talent development, can establish rapport with other stakeholders, particularly educational entities.</p>
                <p>The Labor Force and Credential Holder Objective data inform employers about building a skilled workforce. Such data help employers to determine what the size and skills of the Labor Force are in places where they may remain, expand, relocate, and start new businesses. The Credential Holder Objective gives employers insight into the talent pool needed and others possibly available. Also, knowledge about those employed and unemployed helps employers regarding hiring decisions. In addition, employers may utilize Labor Force and Credential Holder data as a basis for discussions with individuals, education entities, government entities, elected commissioners and councilmen, and others.</p>

Those employees interested in an online course/program, may check out <i>Coursera</i>, a database of courses taught by representatives from business and higher education.</p>
